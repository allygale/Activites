<h1>With - Privacy Policy and Terms of Service</1>

<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<h3>Information we collect</h3>


<h4>Information you provide us directly</h4>

<ul>

<li>Facebook account information, such as your name, profile picture and email address, when you register for an account with the Service.
<li>User Content (e.g., plans, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.
<li>Communications between you and With. For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices).</li></ul>

<h4>Analytics information</h4>

<ul>

<li>We use third-party and first-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information from your device, including information about your device and your usage of the Service.</li></ul>

<h4>Log file information</h4>

<ul>

<li>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device or browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</li></ul>

<h4>Device identifiers</h4>

<ul>

<li>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by the Service.
<li>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</li></ul>

<h3>How we use your information</h3>


<p>
In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use information that we receive to:
</p><ul>

<li>help you efficiently access your information after you sign in
<li>remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Service;
<li>provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or other forms of marketing
<li>provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service
<li>develop and test new products and features
<li>monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns
<li>diagnose or fix technology problems
<li>automatically update the Service application on your device</li></ul>

<h3>Sharing of your information</h3>


<p>
We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside With (or the group of companies of which With is a part) without your consent, except as noted in this Policy.
</p>
<h4>Parties with whom we may share your information:</h4>

<ul>

<li>We may share User Content and your information (including but not limited to, information from cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and usage data) with businesses that are legally part of the same group of companies that With is part of, or that become part of that group ("Affiliates"). Affiliates may use this information to help provide, understand, and improve the Service (including by providing analytics) and Affiliates' own services (including by providing you with better and more relevant experiences).
<li>We also may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, log files, and device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to you ("Service Providers"). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.
<li>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners. This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.
<li>We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties. We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer associated with you and share that aggregated information.</li></ul>

<h4>Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:</h4>


<p>
We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards.
</p>
<p>
We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you may be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.
</p>
<h3>How we store your information</h3>


<h4>Storage and Processing:</h4>

<ul>

<li>Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which With, its Affiliates or Service Providers maintain facilities.
<li>With, its Affiliates, or Service Providers may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.
<li>By registering for and using the Service you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or to any other country in which With, its Affiliates or Service Providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.
<li>We use commercially reasonable safeguards to help keep the information collected through the Service secure and take reasonable steps (such as requiring you to login via Facebook) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. However, With cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to With or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.
<li>Please do your part to help us. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to emails between you and With, at all times.</li></ul>

You agree that we may notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms.

There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that we do not control, maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service and a third-party web site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. With does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You expressly acknowledge and agree that With is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party services or features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application") and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if With has not itself provided such information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold the With Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.
<li>You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the Service.
<li>We prohibit crawling, scraping, caching or otherwise accessing any content on the Service via automated means, including but not limited to, user profiles and photos (except as may be the result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine with With's express consent).</li></ol>

<p>
<strong>Rights</strong>
</p><ol>

<li>With does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, you hereby grant to With a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to the Service's Privacy Policy.
<li>Some of the Service is supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and promotions, and you hereby agree that With may place such advertising and promotions on the Service or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.
<li>You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or commercial communications as such.
<li>You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service or otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate, misappropriate or infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you post on or through the Service; and (iv) you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.
<li>The Service contains content owned or licensed by With ("With Content"). With Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and, as between you and With, With owns and retains all rights in the With Content and the Service. You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the With Content and you will not reproduce, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on, perform, display, publish, distribute, transmit, broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit the With Content.
<li>The With name and logo are trademarks of With, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of With. In addition, all page headers, custom graphics, button icons and scripts are service marks, trademarks and/or trade dress of With, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without prior written permission from With.
<li>Although it is With's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links and/or equipment. Also, With reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by With, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, With encourages you to maintain your own backup of your Content. In other words, With is not a backup service and you agree that you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. With will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.
<li>You agree that With is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted within the Service. With does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove any Content. If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for that Content.
<li>Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, as between you and With, any Content will be non-confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You acknowledge and agree that your relationship with With is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place With in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of With, and With will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you provide.
<li>It is With's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms, conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, With does not accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions, or other materials, you further agree that With is free to use any such content, information, ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation, developing and marketing products and services, without any liability or payment of any kind to you.</li></ol>

<p>
<strong>Reporting Copyright and Other IP Violations</strong>
</p><ol>

<li>We respect other people's rights, and expect you to do the same.
<li>We provide you with a reporting tool to help you protect your intellectual property rights.
<li>If you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights, we will disable your account when appropriate.</li></ol>

</p>
<p>
<strong>Indemnification</strong>
</p>
<p>
You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the Service) agree to defend (at With's request), indemnify and hold the With Parties harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with any of the following (including as a result of your direct activities on the Service or those conducted on your behalf): (i) your Content or your access to or use of the Service; (ii) your breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation, any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; (iv) your violation of any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities; or (v) any misrepresentation made by you. You will cooperate as fully required by With in the defense of any claim. With reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of With.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Arbitration</strong>
</p>
<p>
Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or With's intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); or (2) violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above ("Excluded Disputes"), you agree that all disputes between you and With (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your relationship with With, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and With hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims" court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor With will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if With is a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either With or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use.
</p>
<p>
You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor With can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify With via electronic mail ("e-mail") within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use this address to opt out:
</p>
<p>
owencmoore+witharbitration@gmail.com
</p>
<p>
You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your With account (or, if relevant, for the Facebook account with which you signed in), and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement.
</p>
<p>
If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with With.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Time Limitation on Claims</strong>
</p>
<p>
You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with With must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Governing Law & Venue</strong>
</p>
<p>
These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF OTHERWISE APPLICABLE. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to resolve any dispute you have with With exclusively in a state or federal court located in Santa Clara, California, and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.
</p>
<p>
If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. With's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition. With reserves the right to change this dispute resolution provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the amendment. This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your transactions with With.

<strong>Entire Agreement</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and With and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and With. You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of With. Any purported assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of With will be null and void. With may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.
